### Data Cleaning 
```{r}

opt_raw = opt

opt_logistic <- opt_raw %>%
  # turn space to NA in ended_37_wk
  mutate(
    cat_birthweight = factor(ifelse(Birthweight < 2500, 0, 1), 
                             levels = c(0, 1)),
    across(where(is.factor), ~na_if(as.character(.), "   "))
  ) %>%
  select(
    # Outcome
    Preg.ended...37.wk, cat_birthweight,
    # Center
    Clinic,
    # demographic
    Age, White, Black, Hisp, Education, Prev.preg, 
    # Coexisting medical condition
    Diabetes, Hypertension, Drug.Add, Use.Alc, # eating disorder
    # dental status ?
    ## missing number of natural teeth
    N.qualifying.teeth, BL..BOP, BL.PD.avg
  )
  
table(opt_logistic$Preg.ended...37.wk)
```


### Logistic Regression

#### Part 1 - Preterm or Not Preterm

#### Model Fitting 
```{r, echo=FALSE}


# --- Fit Base Model ---
  
model.preterm <- glm(as.factor(Preg.ended...37.wk) ~ . - cat_birthweight, data = opt_logistic, 
          family = binomial, na.action = na.exclude)

summary(model.preterm)

# --- Variable Selection --- 

# Backward Selection AIC? 



```


#### Part 2 - Birthweight 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

opt_logistic$cat_birthweight <- as.factor(opt_logistic$cat_birthweight)

model.birthweight <- glm(cat_birthweight ~ . - Preg.ended...37.wk , 
                         data = opt_logistic, family = binomial, 
                         na.action = na.exclude)

summary(model.birthweight)


```
